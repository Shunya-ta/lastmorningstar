		<h2>About the process</h2>
		<p>The process, designed by the modern-day mystic OSHO, is about relaxing and making friends with yourself just the way you are. Tapping into the innate wisdom of your body to heal and restore balance in the body, mind, emotions and of course behaviour patterns.</p>
		<p>In this course you will:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Explore and befriend your body-mind's creative and self-healing capacity.</li>
			<li>Focus this on specific physical symptoms or unwanted behaviours, such as stress, eating imbalances, lack of sleep, quitting smoking, aches or pains – anything that needs to be brought to wholeness and balance again.</li>
			<li>Free yourself from limiting beliefs or behaviours which have held you back in life.</li>
			<li>Remember the language of talking to your body-mind system and receiving its messages to improve your self-care and wellbeing.</li>
			<li>Or simply, you can just rest, offer gratitude to your body and bring balance and harmony in any area of your life that is in need of it.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>The process lasts 1 hour a day for 7 days and will occur via ZOOM:
		<ul>
			<!--<li>Group 2: 27th November - 3rd December, 20:30-21:30 CET (19:30-20:30 UK /21:30-22:30 GR)</li>-->
			<li>7th January - 13th January, 10:00-11:00 CET (9:00-10:00 UK /11:00-12:00 GR)</li>
		</ul>

		<p><i>*It is a requirement to join all 7 days of the process, as each day builds on the previous one.*</i></p>


		<h2>Why this course?</h2>
		<p>Even if we have criticised our body it has been working for us all our life – walking, eating, breathing, digesting, healing… so it is always a good time to become friends with and remember how to communicate with our body, and to listen to the vital messages that it sends us.</p>
		<p>There was a time in our childhood, when we were perfectly in tune with the needs of our body. Listening to our body and following its messages was our second nature. Growing up we have slowly forgotten this innate wisdom, leading to a lack of self care, dis-ease and discomfort. The good news is that the connection is never really lost and it is so easy to re-establish the channel of communication: it is just about tuning in and listening to our body with an attitude of love and gratitude.</p>

		<h2>Is it for me?</h2>
		<p>This course is for anyone who is in need of more rest and self care and who wants to explore a deeper connection with their body. Anyone can join and no prior experience of meditation is needed. This is especially beneficial if you are feeling frazzled, overwhelmed with life's stresses and demands and in need of some rest and deep relaxation.</p>



		<h2>What happens during the process?</h2>

		<p>Lying or sitting absolutely comfortable in the warmth of your own home, you’ll be guided into a deeply relaxed state by my voice. Combining deep relaxation with alertness, you will explore and befriend your body/mind's creative and self healing capacity. You will have the opportunity to focus this on specific physical symptoms or unwanted behaviours, such as stress, eating imbalances, lack of sleep, quitting smoking, aches or pains – anything that needs to be brought to wholeness and balance again. Or simply, to just relax, rest and bring balance and harmony in any area of your life.</p>

		<p>In deep relaxation the unconscious mind becomes very open to positive suggestions and will start working for you in new ways without you consciously having to “do” anything. By bringing awareness to the self-healing process, you will be more relaxed with your body and self-nurturing will start to happen naturally and spontaneously. Although you will be guided by the facilitator’s voice, the process is absolutely yours.</p>

			<h2>Technical requirements</h2>

		<p>A reliable internet connection is needed as well as a space where you can lie down or sit in absolute comfort and undisturbed for an hour.</p>

		<h2>Payment</h2>

		<p>The price of the process is €80.</p>
		<p>However, I would like to make this fully inclusive so I am offering it on a sliding scale. There are three price tiers:</p>
		<p>Tier 1: €30 / Tier 2: €50 / Tier 3: €80</p>
		<p>Contributing with Tier 3, will allow others to participate who are struggling financially and can't afford the full price. Thank you so much for considering this when you make your payment.</p>
		<p><i>*No-one will be turned away for lack of funds - if you would like to participate and have difficulty meeting any of the tiers, <strong>please</strong> get in touch with me.*</i></p>
		<p>Payment can be made via PayPal <a href="https://paypal.me/NCharalampopoulou"> here </a></p>
		<p><i>*Please opt for "paying friends and family" - otherwise paypal will add unnecessary charges related to payment insurance etc.*</i></p>

	<h2>What people have said</h2>
	<div class="quotes">
		<p><i>"The course came at just the right time, after a stressful year of juggling studying and parenting during the pandemic. I had been feeling frazzled and running on empty, and this was just what I needed to reset and recharge. Three weeks on, I am still reaping the benefits of the course."</i> - Charlotte, UK</p>

		<p><i>"I started the course thinking I would focus on specific areas of my life that I needed to work on but I was surprised that the benefits were unexpectedly different. I was amazed at how easy it was to stop smoking and reduce my alcohol consumption. And at the same time a sense of inner peace. It left me wanting more of this "medicine"! :)"</i> - Zozeta, Greece</p>

		<p><i>"During the Body Mind Balancing course led by Niki Sitara I felt deeply supported and tenderly embraced. I still feel like this, because the healing process still goes on. Thanks to this wondeful course I have taken a major step in finding alternatives to behaviour patterns that kept me chained for too long..."</i> - Niovi, Greece</p>

		<h2>About me</h2>

		</div>
		<img class="sitara" src="Sitaraprofilepic.jpeg" alt="Sitara">
		<p>I love the journey of self-enquiry and discovering one’s authentic self. I work with individuals, teams and organisations to share tools that will help bring presence and awareness as well as ease and joy in their work and everyday life. After my life as an environmental and social justice campaigner for 12 years, I discovered that our reality is created from within and that the highest contribution I could make to myself and to the world around me is to transform my inner state of being and to nurture an authentic space from which I can support others in their journey. Since then I have dedicated myself to the path of meditation and have trained in numerous modalities, including Transomatic Dialogue Therapy© with Devageet Newman: a groundbreaking method of self-healing and transformation. All current symptoms, whether physical or psychological, are related to memories stored in the body. By accessing those memories and bringing them to the light of our awareness here and now, we can clear the way for meditation so that authentic transformation can happen. I am also a certified facilitator of OSHO Active Meditations© and Meditative Therapies©. Having never considered myself as “artistically creative”, I discovered that meditation opens up our innate creativity and playfulness. This led me to the art of weaving and to my latest project, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/wuweiweaving">wuwei weaving</a>, where I share freestyle weaving as a tool for meditation, self-discovery and joy.</p>
